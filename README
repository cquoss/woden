  Incubation Disclaimer
  ---------------------

  The Woden project is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache 
  Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Web Services PMC. Incubation is 
  required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates 
  that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have 
  stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While 
  incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or 
  stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully 
  endorsed by the ASF.
  
  
  What is it? 
  -----------
  
  Woden is a Web Service Description Language (WSDL) validating parser. 
  Currently Woden supports WSDL 2.0.
