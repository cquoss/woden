<h1>Woden Incubating 1.0.0 M6 Release Notes</h1>

This is the Milestone 6 (M6) release of <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/woden">Apache Woden</a>.<br />
The Milestone plan is at <a href="http://incubator.apache.org/woden/dev/1.0/milestoneplan.html">http://incubator.apache.org/woden/dev/1.0/milestoneplan.html</a>.

<h2>Incubation Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
  	The Woden project is an effort undergoing <a href="http://incubator.apache.org">incubation at the Apache 
  	Software Foundation (ASF)</a>, sponsored by the Apache Web Services PMC. Incubation is 
  	required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates 
  	that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have 
  	stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While 
  	incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or 
  	stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully 
  	endorsed by the ASF.
</p>

<h2>Key points</h2>
<p>
    Milestone releases will deliver Woden functionality gradually, leading up to a 1.0 release.
    The objective of a 1.0 release will be to deliver a WSDL processor that fully implements the
	W3C WSDL 2.0 specification, including parsing WSDL 2.0 documents into the WSDL 2.0 component
	model and validating their syntax and semantics.
</p>
<p>
Note that the WSDL 2.0 "spec" is currently at W3C Candidate Recommendation and may move to 
Proposed Recommendation towards the end of 2006, then full W3C Recommendation (i.e. a specification)
sometime in early 2007.
</p>
<p>
	The M6 release delivers an implementation of the Woden API based on DOM and 
	Xerces parsing and an implementation based on AXIOM and StAX parsing.
</p>
<p>
	The DOM implementation of Woden has been integrated into Axis2 and SOAP messaging
	based on WSDL 2.0 documents was successfully tested by the WSDL 2.0 working group
	at a W3C Interoperability event in July 2006. Work will commence soon to integrate the
	AXIOM/StAX implementation of Woden into Axis2.
</p>
<p>
	Some remaining objectives include converting WSDL 1.1 documents into the WSDL 2.0 component 
	model so they can be manipulated via the Woden API, serializing Woden's WSDL object model to
	WSDL 2.0 documents and full support for programmatically creating and modifying WSDL 2.0 documents.
</p>
<p>
	The Woden framework and programming model are similar to WSDL4J, such as the
	factory, reader and WSDL xml object model. Other features have been reused or adapted too,
	such as the extension mechanism.
</p>

<h2>What's new in this release?</h2>

<p>This release includes the following new features:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        An implementation of the Woden API based on StAX parsing and AXIOM. This implementation uses the 
        same programming model (API) as the DOM implementation, however a different WSDLFactory implementation
        class is needed to instantiate the StAX/AXIOM implementation (i.e. OMWSDLFactory).
    </li>  
    <li>
        The way that elements are created and added by the Woden API has been change to better
        support the scoping described by the WSDL 2.0 specification. The createXXXElement factory
        methods on <code>DescriptionElement</code> have been removed and instead the addXXXElement 
        methods present on all parent elements instantiate and add the appropriate child elements.
        The relevant child elements have been changed to store their name as an NCName rather than 
        a QName, but the QName is still available via the API (i.e. derived from the target namespace). 
    </li> 
</ul>

<h2>Current Release Structure</h2>

<p>
	The binary distribution contains three Woden jar files described below:<br />
	<ul>
		<li>
			woden-api.jar - Contains only the public Woden API (not yet final). 
			This jar is suitable for those that wish to create their own implementation of 
			the API.
		</li>
		<li>
			woden.jar     - Contains the public Woden API (not yet final) and current DOM 
			and AXIOM implementations.
		</li>
		<li>
			woden-ant.jar - Contains the Ant task ValidateWSDL20.
		</li>
	</ul>
	Woden depends on the following libraries and these are included in the binary distribution:
	<ul>
	    <li>
            Apache WS Commons XmlSchema 1.1 (for representing schemas in the Woden API)
	    </li>
	    <li>
            Apache Xerces 2.8.1 (used by XmlSchema and by the DOM implementation of Woden)
	    </li>
	    <li>
            Apache WS Commons AXIOM 1.1
	    </li>
	    <li>
            Apache Commons Logging API 1.1 (used by the AXIOM implementation of Woden)
	    </li>
	    <li>
	        StAX 1.0.1 API and the Woodstox 3.0.1 implementation  (used by the AXIOM implementation of Woden)
	    </li>
	    <li>
	        WSDL4J 1.6.1 (used by the standalone WSDL 1.1 conversion program)
	    </li>
	</ul>
	The source distribution contains all of the Woden source code; the API source, the implementation source and
	the Ant tasks source. It does not contain the dependent libraries, but the build.properties file specifies
	where they can be obtained from. 
</p>
	

<h2>What's still to do?</h2>

<p>Please see a list of what we think needs doing - and please consider helping out if 
you're interested & able!</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Work is well underway on a URL resolver mechanism.
	</li>
	<li>
	    Unit tests for the WSDL extensions are mostly complete, but tests for the core WSDL 2.0
	    Component model and its underlying Element model are still largely outstanding.
	    These are still crucially important for regression testing further development and 
	    will remain a major focus item for the next milestone. 
	</li>
	<li>
		The User Guide added after M3 needs updating to reflect the functional additions up to M6.
	</li>
	<li>
		Technical design documentation for developers needs to be created, probably on the Woden Wiki. 
	</li>
	<li>
		Integrating the stand-alone WSDL 1.1 to 2.0 converter tool into Woden to produce
		a Woden WSDL 2.0 object model from a parsed WSDL 1.1. document. 
	</li>
  	<li>
  		Validation of MEPs and extension elements (such as those for SOAP and HTTP bindings) 
  		has not yet been implemented.
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		Serialization (e.g. WSDLWriter) has not been implemented.
  	</li>
  	<li>
		Support for non-XML Schema type systems has not yet been implemented.
	</li>
	<li>
	    See the Woden JIRA issues at <a href="http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/Woden">http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/Woden</a>.
	</li>
  	<li>

  	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre>
   WSDLFactory factory = WSDLFactory.newInstance();
   WSDLReader reader = factory.newWSDLReader();
   reader.setFeature(ReaderFeatures.VALIDATION_FEATURE_ID, true); &lt;-- enable WSDL 2.0 validation (optional) 
   DescriptionElement desc = reader.readWSDL(wsdlLoc);            &lt;-- the &lt;description&gt; element
   Description descComp = desc.toComponent();                     &lt;-- the Description component
</pre>
   A custom error handler can also be specified as follows:<br />
<pre>
   DescriptionElement desc = reader.readWSDL(wsdlLoc, handler);
</pre>
   WSDL can be now be parsed from a DOM Element, DOM Document or InputSource using a WSDLSource object:<br />
<pre>
   WSDLFactory factory = WSDLFactory.newInstance();
   WSDLReader reader = factory.newWSDLReader();
   reader.setFeature(WSDLReader.FEATURE_VALIDATION, true);
   WSDLSource wsdlSource = reader.createWSDLSource();
   wsdlSource.setBaseURI(wsdlURI);
   wsdlSource.setSource(docEl);
   DescriptionElement desc = reader.readWSDL(wsdlSource);
   Description descComp = desc.toComponent();
</pre>

<h2>Known Problems/Issues</h2>

<ol>
	<li>
	    The "testSchemaId1G" testcase from the W3C WSDL 2.0 test suite is failing since the 
	    change to XmlSchema 1.1. This appears to be due to a fragid specified for the
	    schemaLocation in a schema import. It requires investigation and resolving, possibly
	    in XmlSchema rather than Woden.
   	</li>
   	<li>
   	    The StAX/AXIOM implementation is less complete than the Xerces/DOM implementation.
   	    For example, extensions are not yet supported as this is awaiting the removal of
   	    some DOM dependencies from the Woden API. This work is underway and will be completed 
   	    for Milestone 7. 
   	</li>
	<li>
		Currently, the only type system supported is W3C XML Schema and this is exposed at 
   		certain points of the API (through the use of the XmlSchema interface). Later on we
   		will consider more general, extendable support for other type systems.
   	</li>
	<li>
		There are still failures in the W3C test suite results for the Component Interchange format testing 
		being conducted by the WSDL 2.0 Working Group. Some of these were resolved at the
		W3C WSDL 2.0 Interop event in early July 2006, but the remainder require investigation.
	</li>
	<li>
		There are insufficient test cases in the test suite for M6. The suite requires more 
   		junit tests for the Woden framework and the W3C WSDL test suite is in the process of 
   		being annotated with assertions that tie each testcase to a validation 
   		rule specified in the WSDL 2.0 spec.  
	</li>
	<li>
	    The current extension mechanism requires statically typed interfaces for each type of
	    extension. This requires the client application to know each required extension and
	    its API. Some investigation has been done on a more flexible, dynamic extension 
	    mechanism and any changes that arise from this should be delivered in M7.
	</li>
